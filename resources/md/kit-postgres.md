The `kit-postgres` library simply extends [next-jdbc](https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc)'s `next.jdbc.result-set/ReadableColumn` and `next.jdbc.prepare/SettableParameter` to serialize `Instant`s, `LocalDate`s, `LocalDateTime`s, and `IPersistentMap`s, and deserialize `Array`s and `PGobject`s. It requires [cheshire](https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire) as a dependency for JSON serialization/deserialization. You can further extend these protocols as you desire.
